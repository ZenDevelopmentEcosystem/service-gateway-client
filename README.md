Service Gateway Client
======================

**NOTE!** WORK IN PROGRESS - NOTHING WORKS!!

The Service Gateway concept can be seen as a service exposure/discovery mechanism
that allow hosts expose private service end-points (network ports) at a protected gateway.

The client runs on the service host that is to expose its service(s) at the gateway.
The [service gateway server](https://github.com/ZenDevelopmentEcosystem/service-gateway-server)
is the center where all the connected client-services are registered and exposed.
